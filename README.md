# Government_fuding_system

Blockchain
This project is a blockchain-based government funding system designed to ensure maximum transparency, accountability, and security in the management of public funds. By leveraging blockchainâ€™s transparent ledger, it minimizes corruption, reduces fraud, and enables decentralized control over the flow of money.

Key Features
Transparent Ledger:
Every transaction is recorded on a public, immutable ledger, ensuring full visibility and traceability of fund movements.

Smart Contracts:
Built using Ethereum Solidity, smart contracts automate and enforce funding rules, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

Security & Fraud Prevention:
Decentralized control and cryptographic security reduce the risk of tampering, making the system resistant to fraud and unauthorized changes.

User-Friendly Interface:
The frontend is developed with React to provide an intuitive and accessible interface for government agencies and the public to track and monitor funds.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React
Blockchain: Ethereum
Smart Contracts: Solidity
