Government Funding System using Blockchain
This project is a blockchain-based government funding system designed to ensure maximum transparency, accountability, and security in the management of public funds. By leveraging blockchainâ€™s transparent ledger, it minimizes corruption and reduces fraud by enabling decentralized control over the flow of money.

Key Features:
Transparent Ledger: Every transaction is recorded on a public, immutable ledger, ensuring full visibility and traceability of fund movements.
Smart Contracts: Built using Ethereum Solidity, smart contracts automate and enforce funding rules, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
Security & Fraud Prevention: Decentralized control and cryptographic security reduce the risk of tampering, making the system resistant to fraud and unauthorized changes.
Frontend: Developed with React to provide a user-friendly interface for government agencies and the public to track and monitor funds.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: React
Blockchain: Ethereum
Smart Contracts: Solidity
This system aims to revolutionize how government funds are distributed and monitored, fostering greater trust and transparency in public financial operations.
